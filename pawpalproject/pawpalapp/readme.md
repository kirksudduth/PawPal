# PawPal

A Django Web Application built by [Kirk Sudduth](https://kirksudduth.github.io/KirkSudduth/ "Check out my personal site :P") for [Nashville Software School: Cohort 40](https://nss-cohort-40.github.io/#)

## Proposal

It can be a task to remember what you've done 5 minutes ago some days. PawPal allows pet owners the affordance of not having to worry whether or not they need to perform any pet-related tasks. Your days are busy enough -- let PawPal help carry the load!

## Project Definition

- Built with _Django_ and _Bootstrap_
- Users can create account and login with _Django_ authentication
- Users can create a new PawPal, a new Activity Type, a new time stamped Activity and a new Message (to PawPal's message board)
- Users can update their email and username as well as any note on an Activity they had created previously
- Users can delete an Activity
- Users can keep up with everything they do for and with their PawPal!
